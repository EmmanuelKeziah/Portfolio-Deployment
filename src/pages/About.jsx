        I'm a creative and committed software developer with a solid foundation
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy building
        smooth user experiences, responsive UIs, and modern web applications.
        With a growing knowledge of state management, hooks like useStates,
        useEffect, and routing, I'm always excited to solve real-world problems
        through clean and efficient code.
