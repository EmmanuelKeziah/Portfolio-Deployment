        I'm a creative and committed software developer with a solid foundation
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I enjoy building
        smooth user experiences, responsive UIs, and modern web applications.
        I'm actively expanding my skills in state management, hooks like
        useState and useEffect, as well as client-side routing. In addition, I'm
        currently learning backend development to grow into a proficient
        full-stack engineer.
